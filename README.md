# GitHub Projects — 1‑Page Quick Start

Use this quick guide to set up a **GitHub Project (new Projects experience)** in minutes.

---

## 1. Create a Project

1. Go to your **GitHub profile** or **organization**
2. Click **Projects → New project**
3. Choose **Blank project** (recommended for first time)
4. Name the project

---

## 2. Pick a View

Start with one view (you can add more later):

* **Table** → planning & lists
* **Board** → Kanban workflow (most common)

---

## 3. Add Work Items

Add items to track work:

* Type `#` to add an existing **issue or PR**
* Click **+ Add item** to create a **draft task**

Draft items are great for ideas not ready to be issues yet.

---

## 4. Set Up Status (Must‑Have)

1. Add a **Status** field (single select)
2. Use simple values:

   * Backlog
   * In Progress
   * Review
   * Done

If using a **Board view**, group columns by **Status**.

---

## 5. Add Optional Fields

Common useful fields:

* **Assignee**
* **Priority** (Low / Medium / High)
* **Due date**
* **Iteration** (for sprints)

Only add fields you’ll actually use.

---

## 6. Connect to Repositories

* Add issues and PRs from your repo to the project
* (Optional) Enable **auto‑add** rules for labeled issues

---

## 7. Create Helpful Views

Examples:

* **My Tasks** → filter by assignee = you
* **Current Work** → status ≠ Done
* **Bugs** → filter by label

---

## 8. Daily Use

* Move items by updating **Status** or dragging cards
* Add notes directly to project items
* Review and clean up weekly
